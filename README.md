## Description
<p align="center">
    <em>Data redaction tool for text files</em>
    <br>
    <P>
    This tool will help you ensure that sensitive information is not unintentionally sent out of your organization.
    </p> 
    <p>
    There are times that troubleshooting issues may require your vendor to analyse your log files. Ideally sensitive information such as IP addresses, hostnames, email addresses and even personal information might need to be redacted / masked.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most of the time, redacting such information is reliant on the engineer eyeballing / searching and replacing sensitive information. Needless to say this is prone to human error and can sometimes take up a lot of an engineer's time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Redactor helps by maintaining a repository of patterns that can be used over and over again to redact files in seconds. Tested timings on redacting a 4GB log file takes less than a minute
    </p>
    <p>
    The tool is configured so that developers may expand on this by using redactor as a module. Or users may just opt to install the tool and run the tool in command line.
    </p>
